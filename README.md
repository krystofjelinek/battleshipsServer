# BattleShips

## Project Description
This project implements the game **BattleShips** (LodÄ›). It is a classic strategy game for two players where they take turns guessing the positions of each other's ships on a grid. The game is implemented as a server application that allows two players to connect and interact.

The server manages game sessions, facilitates communication between players, and enforces game rules.
